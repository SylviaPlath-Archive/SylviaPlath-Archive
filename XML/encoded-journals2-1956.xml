           <l>have come from a Pole, "You like?" and asking  me  if I wanted</l>
           <l>brandy, and me yelling yes and backing into the next room past</l>
           <l>the smug shining blub face of dear <persName>Bert</persName>, looking as if he had</l>

            <l>and screamed yes, and he had obligations in the next room, and</l>
            <l>he was working in London, earning ten pounds a week so he could</l>

            <l>long and hard on the cheek, and when we came out of the room,</l>
            <l>blood was running down his face. His poem <quote>"I did it, I."</quote>Such</l>

            <l>and dynamic chunks of words; his poems are strong and blasting</l>
            <l>like a high wind in steel girders. And Iscreamed in myself,</l>
