            <l>We walked out as the blonde one was coming in, and <persName>Oswald</persName> said</l>
            <l>in his dry sarcasm something about "Tell us about bone structures</l>

            <l>I shall sequester. I don't want fo see anybody because they are</l>

            <l>Well, <persName>Hamish</persName>: and I took an incredibly long time walking about</l>
            <l>the misty streets in the moonlight and all was blurred behind</l>
            <l>a theatrical scrim of fog, and <del rend="overwritten">v</del>ague boys in black gowns staggered</l>
            <l>and sang. We hid behind a car, and he sild, the oroctors are</l>
            <l>out after me,and I kept blithering on about having faith and</l>
            <l>being lucky, always, if you believe in something, because you</l>
            <l>can walk on water. Finally, after many strange streets which</l>
            <l>I did not know, being far far away in a land of whisky and</l>
            <l>merrydown, saying <persName role="husband">Ted</persName> to the lam<unclear rend="faded">pp</unclear>osts and calding myself with</l>
            <l><persName>Hamish</persName> <persName>Hamish</persName>, keeping saying it aloud to him, because he took</l>
            <l>me away safely. We came to the gates of <placeName>Queens</placeName>, and I wanted</l>
            <l>like a baby to lie down and rest, Just peace, peace, I kept</l>
            <l>whispering. Five boys, <del rend="overwritten">f</del>ive late babies came up, and surrounded</l>
            <l>me, gently saying, what are you doing here, are you all right,</l>
            <l>my you smell nice, that perfume, and may we kiss you, and I</l>
            <l>just stood there huddled to the iron fence, smiling like a lost</l>
            <l>lamb and saying dear, dear, babies, and then <persName>Hamish</persName> was among</l>
            <l> them, and they climbed over and crossed the wooden bridge</l>
            <l>that <persName role="scientist">N<del rend="overwritten">e</del>wton</persName> once put together without bolts.</l>

            <l><persName>Hamish</persName> helped me up on the wall, and in my tight skirt, I</l>
            <l>tried to step over the spikes; they pierced my skirt, my hands</l>
            <l>and I felt nothing, thinking from the great distance that I</l>
            <l>might at last li<del rend="cross out">...</del>e on a bed of solkes and not feel 1t, like</l>
            <l>the yoga, like celia copplestone, crucified, near an anthill,</l>
            <l>at last, peace, and the nails went through my hands, and my</l>
            <l>legs were bare to the thigh, and I was over. The stigmata, I</l>

            <l>over in an act of sublime drunkenness and falth. And then we</l>

            <l>I was just so damn grateful for his weight on <del rend="overwritten">me</del> and his mouth</l>
            <l>which was nice, and begged that he scold me, and he Just sald</l>
            <l>I wasn't a whore or a slut like I said but only a very silly</l>
            <l>girl and he kind of liked me and when would I learn-my lesson.</l>
            <l>When? When? So 1t was suddenly twoâ€”thirty, and I couldn't</l>
            <l>imagine being illegal, but I was, and we managed by the light</l>
            <l>of two matches to get downstairs, and he w<del rend="overwritten">al</del>ked out, a dark</l>
            <l>lone figure against the pale white blur of snow in the dead</l>
