         <div class="l"></div>
         <p> sober, with cold white puritan<span class="cross out">m</span>ical eyes; looking at me. Last</p>
         <div class="l"></div>
         <p> night I got drunk, very very beautifully drunk, and now I am</p>
         <div class="l"></div>
         <p> shot, after six holirs of warm sleep like a baby, with <span class="persName">Racine</span></p>
         <div class="l"></div>
         <p> to read, and not even the energy to type; I am getting the dts.</p>
         <div class="l"></div>
         <p> Or so<span class="overwritten">me</span>thing.</p>
         <div class="l"></div><br/><br/><p id="p2"><span class="persName">Hamish</span> came in cab, and there was a tedious time standing slanted</p>
         <div class="l"></div>
         <p> against, the bar in <span class="placeName">Miller's </span>with some ugly gat-toothed squat</p>
         <div class="l"></div>
         <p> grinning guy named <span class="persName"><span class="overwritten">M</span>eeson</span>trying to be devastatingly clever and</p>

         <div class="l"></div>
         <p> pale, pink and light blue eyes. I drank steadily the goblets</p>
         <div class="l"></div>
         <p> with the red<span class="unclear">...[?]</span>gold Whiskey Macs, one-after the other, and by</p>
         <div class="l"></div>
         <p> the time we left an hour later, I felt that strong, silted-up</p>
         <div class="l"></div>
         <p> force that makes one move through air like swimming, with</p>
         <div class="l"></div>
         <p> brave ease.</p>
         <div class="l"></div><br/><br/><p id="p3"><span class="orgName">Falcon's Yard</span>, and the syncopated strut of a piano upstairs,</p>
         <div class="l"></div>
         <p> and oh it was very Bohemian, with boys in turtle-neck sweaters</p>
         <div class="l"></div>
         <p> and girls being blue-eye-lidded or elegant in black. <span class="persName">Derrek</span></p>
         <div class="l"></div>
         <p> was there, with guitar, and <span class="persName">Bert</span> was looking shining and proud</p>
         <div class="l"></div>
         <p> as if he had just delivered five babies, sald something obvious</p>
         <div class="l"></div>
         <p> about having drunk alot, and began talking about how <span class="persName">Luke</span> was</p>
         <div class="l"></div>
         <p> satanic after he had rur through the poetry in <span class="placeName">St. Botolph's</span></p>
         <div class="l"></div>
         <p> and yelled about it: satanic <span class="persName">Luke</span>, very very drunk, with a</p>
         <div class="l"></div>
         <p> stupid satanic smile on his pale face, dark sideburns and</p>
         <div class="l"></div>
         <p> rumpled hair, black-and-white checked baggy pants and a loose</p>
         <div class="l"></div>
         <p> swinging jacket, was doling that slow crazy english jive with</p>
         <div class="l"></div>
         <p> a green-clad girl, quite black-halred and eyed and a good</p>
         <div class="l"></div>
         <p> part pixie, and when they stopped dancing, <span class="persName">Luke</span> was chasing</p>
         <div class="l"></div>
         <p> her around. <span class="persName">Dan Huys</span> being very pale, frightfully pale and</p>
         <div class="l"></div>
         <p> freckled, and me at last saying my immortal line of introduction</p>
         <div class="l"></div>
         <p> which has been with me ever since his clever precocious</p>
         <div class="l"></div>
         <p> slanted review: "Is this the better or worse half?" and he</p>
         <div class="l"></div>
         <p> looking incredibly young to even think hard yet.<span class="persName">Than Minton</span>,</p>
         <div class="l"></div>
         <p> so small and dark one would have fo slit down to talk to him,</p>
         <div class="l"></div>
         <p> and <span class="persName">Welssbort</span>, small again and very cur<span class="overwritten">l</span>y. Ross, immaculate<span class="cross out">m</span></p>
         <div class="l"></div>
         <p> and dark. They were all dark.</p>
         <div class="l"></div>
         <p> <br/> </p>
         <p id="p4">By this time I had spilled one drink, partly into my mouth,</p>
         <div class="l"></div>
         <p> partly over my hands and floor, and the Jazz was beginning</p>
         <div class="l"></div>
         <p> to get under my skin, and I started dancing with <span class="persName">Luke</span> and</p>
         <div class="l"></div>
         <p> knew I was very bad, having crossed the river and banged</p>
         <div class="l"></div>
         <p> into the trees, yelling about the poems, and he only smiling</p>
         <div class="l"></div>
         <p> with that far-off look of a c<span class="unclear">e[?]</span>etin satan. he wrote those</p>
         <div class="l"></div>
         <p> things, and he was slobbing around. Well, I was slobbing</p>
         <div class="l"></div>
         <p> around, ‘blub, maundering" and I didn't even have the excuse</p>
         <div class="l"></div>
         <p> of having written those things; I suppose if you can write</p>
         <div class="l"></div>
         <p> sestinas which<span class="cross out">mm</span>bam crash through lines and rules after</p>
         <div class="l"></div>
         <p> having raped them to the purpose, then you can be satanic and</p>
         <div class="l"></div>
         <p> smile like a cretin beelzebub.</p>
         <div class="l"></div>
         <p> <br/> </p>
         <p id="p5">Then the worst happened, that big, dark, hunky boy, the only</p>
         <div class="l"></div>
         <p> one there huge enough for me, who ha<span class="overwritten">ve</span> been hunching around</p>
         <div class="l"></div>
         <p> over women, and whose name I had asked the minute I had come</p>
         <div class="l"></div>
         <p> into the room, but no one told me, came over and was looking</p>
         <div class="l"></div>
         <p> hard in my eyes and it was <span class="persName">Ted Hughes</span>. I started yelling</p>
         <div class="l"></div>
         <p> again about his poems and quoting: "<span class="overwritten">m</span>ost dear unscratchable</p>
         <div class="l"></div>
