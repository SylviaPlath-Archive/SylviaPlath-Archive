           A small note after a large orgy. It is morning, gray, most<l/>
           sober, with cold white puritan<del><gap reason="deleted" quantity="1" unit="character"></gap></del>ical eyes; looking at me. Last<l/>
           night I got drunk, very very beautifully drunk, and now I am<l/>
           shot, after six holirs of warm sleep like a baby, with <persName ref="#Racine">Racine</persName><l/>
           to read, and not even the energy to type; I am getting the dts.<l/>

          against, the bar in <placeName ref="#Miller">Miller's </placeName>with some ugly gat-toothed squat<l/>
          grinning guy named <persName ref="#Meeson">Meeson</persName>trying to be devastatingly clever and<l/>
          making intense devastating remarks about nothing. <persName>Hamish</persName><l/>
          pale, pink and light blue eyes. I drank steadily the goblets<l/>
          with the red<gap reason="#illegible"></gap>gold Whiskey Macs, one-after the other, and by<l/>
          the time we left an hour later, I felt that strong, silted-up<l/>
          force that makes one move through air like swimming, with<l/>
          brave ease.<l/>

           was there, with guitar, and <persName ref="#Bert">Bert</persName> was looking shining and proud<l/>
           as if he had just delivered five babies, sald something obvious<l/>
           about having drunk alot, and began talking about how <persName ref="#Luke">Luke</persName> was<l/>
           satanic after he had rur through the poetry in <placeName ref="#St.Botolphs">St. Botolph's</placeName><l/>

           freckled, and me at last saying my immortal line of introduction<l/>

            with that far-off look of a cretin satan. he wrote those<l/>
           things, and he was slobbing around. Well, I was slobbing<l/>
           around, â€˜blub, maundering" and I didn't even have the excuse<l/>
