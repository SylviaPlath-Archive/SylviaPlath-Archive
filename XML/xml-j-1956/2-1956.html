         <div class="l"></div>
         <p> have come from a Pole, "You like?" and asking me if I wanted</p>
         <div class="l"></div>
         <p> brandy, and me yelling yes and backing into the next room past</p>
         <div class="l"></div>
         <p> the smug shining blub face of dear <span class="persName">Bert</span>, looking as if he had</p>
         <div class="l"></div>
         <p> delivered at least nine or ten babies, and bang the door was</p>
         <div class="l"></div>
         <p> shut and he was sloshing brandy into a glass and I was sloshing</p>
         <div class="l"></div>
         <p> it at the place <span class="strikethrough"><span class="gap"> [...]</span></span> where my mouth was when I last knew about it.</p>
         <div class="l"></div><br/><p>We shouted as if in a high wind, about the review, and he saying</p>
         <div class="l"></div>
         <p> <span class="persName">Dan</span> knew I was beautiful, he wouldn't have written it about a</p>
         <div class="l"></div>
         <p> cripple, and my yelling drotest in which the words "sleep with</p>
         <div class="l"></div>
         <p> the editor" occurred with startling frequency. And then it</p>
         <div class="l"></div>
         <p> came to the fact that I was all there, wasn't I, and I stamped</p>
         <div class="l"></div>
         <p> and screamed yes, and he had obligations in the next room, and</p>
         <div class="l"></div>
         <p> he was working in <span class="placeName">London</span>, earning ten pounds a week so he could</p>
         <div class="l"></div>
         <p> later earn twelve pounds a week, and I was stamping and he was</p>
         <div class="l"></div>
         <p> stampig on the floor, and then hekissed me bang smash on the</p>
         <div class="l"></div>
         <p> mouth and ripped my hairband off, my lovely red hairband scarf</p>
         <div class="l"></div>
         <p> which has weathered the sun and much love, and whose like I</p>
         <div class="l"></div>
         <p> shall never again find, and my favorite silver earrings: hah, I</p>
         <div class="l"></div>
         <p> shall keep, he barked. And when he kissed my neck I bit him</p>
         <div class="l"></div>
         <p> long and hard on the cheek, and when we came out of the room,</p>
         <div class="l"></div>
         <p> blood was running down his face. His poem <span class="quote">‘"I did it, I."’</span>Such</p>
         <div class="l"></div>
         <p> violence, and I can see how women lie down for artists. The one</p>
         <div class="l"></div>
         <p> man in the room who was as big as his poems, huge, with hulk</p>
         <div class="l"></div>
         <p> and dynamic chunks of words; his poems are strong and blasting</p>
         <div class="l"></div>
         <p> like a high wind in steel girders. And I screamed in myself,</p>
         <div class="l"></div>
         <p> thinking: oh, to give myself crashing, fighting, to you. The</p>
         <div class="l"></div>
         <p> one man since I've lived who could blast <span class="persName">Richard</span>.</p>
         <div class="l"></div><br/><p>And now I sit here, demure and tired in brown, slightly sick</p>
         <div class="l"></div>
         <p> at heart. I shall zo on. I shall write a detalled description <span class="strikethrough"><span class="gap"> [...]</span></span></p>
         <div class="l"></div>
         <p> of shock treatment, tight, blasting short descriptions with</p>
         <div class="l"></div>
         <p> not one smudge of coy sentimentality, and when I get enough</p>
         <div class="l"></div>
         <p> I shall send them to <span class="persName">David Ross</span>. There will be no hurry,</p>
         <div class="l"></div>
         <p> because I am too desperately vengeful now. But I will pile them</p>
         <div class="l"></div>
         <p> up. I thought about the shock treatment description last night:</p>
         <div class="l"></div>
         <p> the deadly sleep of her madness, and the breakfast not coming,</p>
         <div class="l"></div>
         <p> the little details, the flashback to the shock treatment that</p>
         <div class="l"></div>
         <p> went wrong: electrocution brought in, and the inevitable</p>
         <div class="l"></div>
         <p> going down the subterranean hall, waking to a new world, with</p>
         <div class="l"></div>
         <p> no name, being born again, and not of woman.</p>
         <div class="l"></div><br/><p>I shall never see him again, and the thorny limitations of the</p>
         <div class="l"></div>
         <p> day crowd in like the spikes on the gates at Queens last night</p>
         <div class="l"></div>
         <p> I could never sleep with him anyway, with all his friends here</p>
         <div class="l"></div>
         <p> and his close relation to them, laughing, talking, I should</p>
         <div class="l"></div>
         <p> be the world's whore, as well as <span class="persName">Roget</span>'s strumpet. I shall never</p>
         <div class="l"></div>
         <p> see him, he will never look for me. He said my name, <span class="persName">Sylvia</span>,</p>
         <div class="l"></div>
         <p> and banged a black grinning look into my eyes, and I would like</p>
         <div class="l"></div>
         <p> to try just this once, my force against his. But he will never</p>
         <div class="l"></div>
         <p> come, and the blonde one, pure and snug and favored, looks, is</p>
         <div class="l"></div>
         <p> it with projected nity and disguat<span class="gap"> [...]</span>at this drunken amo<span class="gap"> [...]</span>hic slut.</p>
         <div class="l"></div><br/><p>But <span class="persName">Hamish</span> was very kind and would have fought for me. It gave</p>
         <div class="l"></div>
         <p> him a kind of glory to take me away from them, those fiends and I am worth fighting
            for, I had been nice, to him, he said.</p>
