         <p>diamond" and he yelled back, colossal, in a voice that should<l/>
            have come from a Pole, "You like?" and asking  me  if I wanted<l/>
            brandy, and me yelling yes and backing into the next room past<l/>
            the smug shining blub face of dear <persName ref="#Bert">Bert</persName>, looking as if he had<l/>
            delivered at least nine or ten babies, and bang the door was<l/>
            shut and he was sloshing brandy into a glass and I was sloshing<l/>
            it at the place <del><gap reason="deleted" quantity="3" unit="character"></gap></del> where my mouth was when I last knew about it.<l/></p>
     
         <lb></lb>
         
         <p>We shouted as if in a high wind, about the review, and he saying<l/>
            <persName ref="#DanielWeissbort">Dan</persName> knew I was beautiful, he wouldn't have written it about a<l/>
            cripple, and my yelling drotest in which the words "sleep with<l/>
            the editor" occurred with startling frequency. And then it<l/>
            came to the fact that I was all there, wasn't I, and I stamped<l/>
            and screamed yes, and he had obligations in the next room, and<l/>
            he was working in <placeName ref="#London">London</placeName>, earning ten pounds a week so he could<l/>
            later earn twelve pounds a week, and I was stamping and he was<l/>
            stampig on the floor, and then hekissed me bang smash on the<l/>
            mouth and ripped my hairband off, my lovely red hairband scarf<l/>
            which has weathered the sun and much love, and whose like I<l/>
            shall never again find, and my favorite silver earrings: hah, I<l/>
            shall keep, he barked. And when he kissed my neck I bit him<l/>
            long and hard on the cheek, and when we came out of the room,<l/>
            blood was running down his face. His poem <quote>"I did it, I."</quote>Such<l/>
            violence, and I can see how women lie down for artists. The one<l/>
            man in the room who was as big as his poems, huge, with hulk<l/>
            and dynamic chunks of words; his poems are strong and blasting<l/>
            like a high wind in steel girders. And I screamed in myself,<l/>
            thinking: oh, to give myself crashing, fighting, to you. The<l/>
            one man since I've lived who could blast <persName ref="#Richard">Richard</persName>.<l/></p>
             
         <lb></lb>
            
         <p>And now I sit here, demure and tired in brown, slightly sick<l/>
            at heart. I shall zo on. I shall write a detalled description <del><gap reason="deleted" quantity="1" unit="character"></gap></del><l/>
            of shock treatment, tight, blasting short descriptions with<l/>
            not one smudge of coy sentimentality, and when I get enough<l/>
            I shall send them to <persName ref="#DavidRoss">David Ross</persName>. There will be no hurry,<l/>
            because I am too desperately vengeful now. But I will pile them<l/>
            up. I thought about the shock treatment description last night:<l/>
            the deadly sleep of her madness, and the breakfast not coming,<l/>
            the little details, the flashback to the shock treatment that<l/>
            went wrong: electrocution brought in, and the inevitable<l/>
            going down the subterranean hall, waking to a new world, with<l/>
            no name, being born again, and not of woman.<l/></p>
              
         <lb></lb>
            
         <p>I shall never see him again, and the thorny limitations of the<l/>
            day crowd in like the spikes on the gates at Queens last night<l/>
            I could never sleep with him anyway, with all his friends here<l/>
            and his close relation to them, laughing, talking, I should<l/>
            be the world's whore, as well as <persName ref="#Roget">Roget</persName>'s strumpet. I shall never<l/>
            see him, he will never look for me. He said my name, <persName ref="#SylviaPlath">Sylvia</persName>,<l/>
            and banged a black grinning look into my eyes, and I would like<l/>
            to try just this once, my force against his. But he will never<l/>
            come, and the blonde one, pure and snug and favored, looks, is<l/>
            it with projected nity and disguat<gap reason="illegible" quantity="1" unit="character"></gap>at this drunken amo<gap reason="illegible" quantity="2" unit="character"></gap>hic slut.<l/></p>
        
         <lb></lb>
             
         <p>But <persName ref="#HamishStewart">Hamish</persName> was very kind and would have fought for me. It gave<l/>
            him a kind of glory to take me away from them, those fiends and I am worth fighting for, I had been nice, to him, he said.<l/></p>
