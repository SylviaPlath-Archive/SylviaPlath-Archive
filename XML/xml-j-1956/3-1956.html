         <p>19.</p><br/><p><span class="date">February 26</span></p><br/><p>We walked out as the blonde one was coming in, and <span class="persName">Oswald</span> said</p>
         <div class="l"></div>
         <p> in his dry sarcasm something about "Tell us about bone structures</p>
         <div class="l"></div>
         <p> and that was the last party at Saint John's where I lost the</p>
         <div class="l"></div>
         <p> red glove, as tonight I last the red bandeau which I loved with</p>
         <div class="l"></div>
         <p> all the redness in my heart. Somehow these sluttish nights make</p>
         <div class="l"></div>
         <p> me have a violent nunlike passion to write and sequester myself.</p>
         <div class="l"></div>
         <p> I shall sequester. I don't want fo see anybody because they are</p>
         <div class="l"></div>
         <p> not <span class="persName">Ted Hughes</span>and I never have been made a fool of by a man.</p>
         <div class="l"></div>
         <p> They are phonies, <span class="persName">Hamish</span> said: He is the biggest seducer in</p>
         <div class="l"></div>
         <p> <span class="placeName">Cambridge</span>. Shall I write, and be different? Always, I grab it,</p>
         <div class="l"></div>
         <p> the writing, hold it to me, defend, defend, against the flux,</p>
         <div class="l"></div>
         <p> the sameness of faces. He said my name, <span class="persName">Sylvia</span>, in a blasting</p>
         <div class="l"></div>
         <p> wind which shot off in the desert behind my eyes, behind his</p>
         <div class="l"></div>
         <p> eyes, and his poems are clever and terrible and lovely.</p>
         <div class="l"></div><br/><p>Well, <span class="persName">Hamish</span>: and I took an incredibly long time walking about</p>
         <div class="l"></div>
         <p> he misty streets in the moonlight and all was blurred behind</p>
         <div class="l"></div>
         <p> a theatrical scrim of fog, and vague boys in black gowns staggered</p>
         <div class="l"></div>
         <p> and sang. We hid behind a car, and he sild, the oroctors are</p>
         <div class="l"></div>
         <p> out after me,and I kept blithering on about having faith and</p>
         <div class="l"></div>
         <p> being lucky, always, if you believe in something, because you</p>
         <div class="l"></div>
         <p> can walk on water. Finally, after many strange streets which</p>
         <div class="l"></div>
         <p> I did not know, being far far away in a land of whisky and</p>
         <div class="l"></div>
         <p> merrydown, saying <span class="persName">Ted</span> to the lam<span class="faded">po[?]</span>osts and calding myself with</p>
         <div class="l"></div>
         <p> <span class="persName">Hamish</span>, keeping saying it aloud to him, because he took</p>
         <div class="l"></div>
         <p> me away safely. We came to the gates of Queens, and I wanted</p>
         <div class="l"></div>
         <p> like a baby to lie down and rest, Just peace, peace, I kept</p>
         <div class="l"></div>
         <p> whispering. Five boys, five late babies came up, and surrounded</p>
         <div class="l"></div>
         <p> me, gently saying, what are you doing here, are you all right,</p>
         <div class="l"></div>
         <p> my you smell nice, that perfume, and may we kiss you, and I</p>
         <div class="l"></div>
         <p> just stood there huddled to the iron fence, smiling like a lost</p>
         <div class="l"></div>
         <p> lamb and saying dear, dear, babies, and then <span class="persName">Hamish</span> was among</p>
         <div class="l"></div>
         <p> them, and they climbed over and crossed the wooden bridge</p>
         <div class="l"></div>
         <p> that <span class="persName">Newton</span> once put together without bolts.</p>
         <div class="l"></div><br/><br/><p><span class="persName">Hamish</span> helped me up on the wall, and in my tight skirt, I</p>
         <div class="l"></div>
         <p> tried to step over the spikes; they pierced my skirt, my hands</p>
         <div class="l"></div>
         <p> and I felt nothing, thinking from the great distance that I</p>
         <div class="l"></div>
         <p> might at last lie on a bed of solkes and not feel 1t, like</p>
         <div class="l"></div>
         <p> the yoga, like celia copplestone, crucified, near an anthill,</p>
         <div class="l"></div>
         <p> at last, peace, and the nails went through my hands, and my</p>
         <div class="l"></div>
         <p> egs were bare to the thigh, and I was over. The stigmata, I</p>
         <div class="l"></div>
         <p> sald, frozen, looking at those raw frigid hands that should</p>
         <div class="l"></div>
         <p> have been bleeding. But they were not bleeding. I had gotten</p>
         <div class="l"></div>
         <p> over in an act of sublime drunkenness and falth. And then we</p>
         <div class="l"></div>
         <p> we<sup class="overwrite">nt</sup> to <span class="persName">Hamish</span>'s room and lay on the floor by the fire and</p>
         <div class="l"></div>
         <p> I was just so damn grateful for his weight on me and his mouth</p>
         <div class="l"></div>
         <p> which was nice, and begged that he scold me, and he Just sald</p>
         <div class="l"></div>
         <p> I wasn't a whore or a slut like I said but only a very silly</p>
         <div class="l"></div>
         <p> girl and he kind of liked me and when would I learn-my lesson.</p>
         <div class="l"></div>
         <p> When? When? So 1t was suddenly two—thirty, and I couldn't</p>
         <div class="l"></div>
         <p> imagine being illegal, but I was, and we managed by the light</p>
         <div class="l"></div>
         <p> of two matches to get downstairs, and he walked out, a dark</p>
         <div class="l"></div>
         <p> lone figure against the pale white blur of snow in the dead</p>
         <div class="l"></div>
         <p> quiet crescent court.</p>
