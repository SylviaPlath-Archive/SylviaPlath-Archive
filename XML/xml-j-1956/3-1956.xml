         <p>We walked out as the blonde one was coming in, and <persName ref="#Oswald">Oswald</persName> said<l/>
            in his dry sarcasm something about "Tell us about bone structures<l/>
            and that was the last party at Saint John's where I lost the<l/>
            red glove, as tonight I last the red bandeau which I loved with<l/>
            all the redness in my heart. Somehow these sluttish nights make<l/>
            me have a violent nunlike passion to write and sequester myself.<l/>
            I shall sequester. I don't want fo see anybody because they are<l/>
            not <persName ref="#TedHughes">Ted Hughes</persName>and I never have been made a fool of by a man.<l/>
            They are phonies, <persName ref="#HamishStewart">Hamish</persName> said: He is the biggest seducer in<l/>
            <placeName ref="#Cambridge">Cambridge</placeName>. Shall I write, and be different? Always, I grab it,<l/>
            the writing, hold it to me, defend, defend, against the flux,<l/>
            the sameness of faces. He said my name, <persName ref="#SylviaPlath">Sylvia</persName>, in a blasting<l/>
            wind which shot off in the desert behind my eyes, behind his<l/>
            eyes, and his poems are clever and terrible and lovely.<l/></p>
          
         <lb></lb>
            
         <p>Well, <persName ref="#HamishStewart">Hamish</persName>: and I took an incredibly long time walking about<l/>
            he misty streets in the moonlight and all was blurred behind<l/>
            a theatrical scrim of fog, and vague boys in black gowns staggered<l/>
            and sang. We hid behind a car, and he sild, the oroctors are<l/>
            out after me,and I kept blithering on about having faith and<l/>
            being lucky, always, if you believe in something, because you<l/>
            can walk on water. Finally, after many strange streets which<l/>
            I did not know, being far far away in a land of whisky and<l/>
            merrydown, saying <persName ref="#TedHughes">Ted</persName> to the lam<unclear rend="faded">po</unclear>osts and calding myself with<l/>
            <persName ref="#HamishStewart">Hamish</persName>, keeping saying it aloud to him, because he took<l/>
            me away safely. We came to the gates of Queens, and I wanted<l/>
            like a baby to lie down and rest, Just peace, peace, I kept<l/>
            whispering. Five boys, five late babies came up, and surrounded<l/>
            me, gently saying, what are you doing here, are you all right,<l/>
            my you smell nice, that perfume, and may we kiss you, and I<l/>
            just stood there huddled to the iron fence, smiling like a lost<l/>
            lamb and saying dear, dear, babies, and then <persName ref="#HamishStewart">Hamish</persName> was among<l/>
            them, and they climbed over and crossed the wooden bridge<l/>
            that <persName ref="#IsaacNewton">Newton</persName> once put together without bolts.<l/></p>
         
         <lb></lb>
         <lb></lb>
            
         <p><persName ref="HamishStewart">Hamish</persName> helped me up on the wall, and in my tight skirt, I<l/>
            tried to step over the spikes; they pierced my skirt, my hands<l/>
            and I felt nothing, thinking from the great distance that I<l/>
            might at last lie on a bed of solkes and not feel 1t, like<l/>
            the yoga, like celia copplestone, crucified, near an anthill,<l/>
            at last, peace, and the nails went through my hands, and my<l/>
            egs were bare to the thigh, and I was over. The stigmata, I<l/>
            sald, frozen, looking at those raw frigid hands that should<l/>
            have been bleeding. But they were not bleeding. I had gotten<l/>
            over in an act of sublime drunkenness and falth. And then we<l/>
            we<add place="above" rend="overwrite">nt</add> to <persName ref="#HamishStewart">Hamish</persName>'s room and lay on the floor by the fire and<l/>
            I was just so damn grateful for his weight on me and his mouth<l/>
            which was nice, and begged that he scold me, and he Just sald<l/>
            I wasn't a whore or a slut like I said but only a very silly<l/>
            girl and he kind of liked me and when would I learn-my lesson.<l/>
            When? When? So 1t was suddenly twoâ€”thirty, and I couldn't<l/>
            imagine being illegal, but I was, and we managed by the light<l/>
            of two matches to get downstairs, and he walked out, a dark<l/>
            lone figure against the pale white blur of snow in the dead<l/>
            quiet crescent court.<l/>
