         <p>A small note after a large orgy. It is morning, gray, most<l/>
            sober, with cold white puritan<del><gap reason="deleted" quantity="1" unit="character"></gap></del>ical eyes; looking at me. Last<l/>
            night I got drunk, very very beautifully drunk, and now I am<l/>
            shot, after six holirs of warm sleep like a baby, with <persName ref="#JeanRacine">Racine</persName><l/>
            to read, and not even the energy to type; I am getting the dts.<l/>
            Or something.<l/>

         <lb></lb>
        
         <p><persName ref="#HamishStweart">Hamish</persName> came in cab, and there was a tedious time standing slanted<l/>
            against, the bar in Miller's with some ugly gat-toothed squat<l/>
            grinning guy named <persName ref="#Meeson">Meeson</persName>trying to be devastatingly clever and<l/>
            making intense devastating remarks about nothing. <persName ref="#HamishStewart">Hamish</persName><l/>
            pale, pink and light blue eyes. I drank steadily the goblets<l/>
            with the red-gold Whiskey Macs, one-after the other, and by<l/>
            the time we left an hour later, I felt that strong, silted-up<l/>
            force that makes one move through air like swimming, with<l/>
            brave ease.<l/></p>
         
         <lb></lb>
         
         <p><hi rend="underline">Falcon's Yard</hi>, and the syncopated strut of a piano upstairs,<l/>
            and oh it was very Bohemian, with boys in turtle-neck sweaters<l/>
            and girls being blue-eye-lidded or elegant in black. <persName ref="#Derrek">Derrek</persName><l/>
            was there, with guitar, and <persName ref="#Bert">Bert</persName> was looking shining and proud<l/>
            as if he had just delivered five babies, sald something obvious<l/>
            about having drunk alot, and began talking about how <persName ref="#LucasMyers">Luke</persName> was<l/>
            satanic after he had run through the poetry in <objectName ref="#St.Botolphs">St. Botolph's</objectName><l/>
            and yelled about it: satanic <persName ref="#LucasMyers">Luke</persName>, very very drunk, with a<l/>
            stupid satanic smile on his pale face, dark sideburns and<l/>
            rumpled hair, black-and-white checked baggy pants and a loose<l/>
            swinging jacket, was doling that slow crazy english jive with<l/>
            a green-clad girl, quite black-haired and eyed and a good<l/>
            part pixie, and when they stopped dancing, <persName ref="#LucasMyers">Luke</persName> was chasing<l/>
            her around. <persName ref="#DanHuws">Dan Huys</persName> being very pale, frightfully pale and<l/>
            freckled, and me at last saying my immortal line of introduction<l/>
            which has been with me ever since his clever precocious<l/>
            slanted review: "Is this the better or worse half?" and he<l/>
            looking incredibly young to even think hard yet.<persName ref="#ThanMorton">Than Minton</persName>,<l/>
            so small and dark one would have fo slit down to talk to him,<l/>
            and <persName ref="#DavidWeissbort">Weissbort</persName>, small again and very curvy. <persName ref="DavidRoss">Ross</persName>, immaculate<del><gap reason="deleted" quantity="1" unit="character"></gap></del><l/>
            and dark. They were all dark.</p>
           
        <lb></lb>   
            
        <p>By this time I had spilled one drink, partly into my mouth,<l/>
            partly over my hands and floor, and the Jazz was beginning<l/>
            to get under my skin, and I started dancing with <persName ref="#LucasMyers">Luke</persName> and<l/>
            knew I was very bad, having crossed the river and banged<l/>
            into the trees, yelling about the poems, and he only smiling<l/>
            with that far-off look of a cretin satan. he wrote those<l/>
            things, and he was slobbing around. Well, I was slobbing<l/>
            around, ‘blub, maundering" and I didn't even have the excuse<l/>
            of having written those things; I suppose if you can write<l/>
            sestinas which <del><gap reason="deleted" quantity="2" unit="character"></gap></del>bam crash through lines and rules after<l/>
            having raped them to the purpose, then you can be satanic and<l/>
            smile like a cretin beelzebub.</p>

         <p>Then the worst happened, that big, dark, hunky boy, the only<l/>
            one there huge enough for me, who have been hunching around<l/>
            over women, and whose name I had asked the minute I had come<l/>
            into the room, but no one told me, came over and was looking<l/>
            hard in my eyes and it was <persName ref="#TedHughes">Ted Hughes</persName>. I started yelling<l/>
            again about his poems and quoting: "most dear unscratchable</p>

         <p>diamond" and he yelled back, colossal, in a voice that should<l/>
            have come from a Pole, "You like?" and asking  me  if I wanted<l/>
            brandy, and me yelling yes and backing into the next room past<l/>
            the smug shining blub face of dear <persName ref="#Bert">Bert</persName>, looking as if he had<l/>
            delivered at least nine or ten babies, and bang the door was<l/>
            shut and he was sloshing brandy into a glass and I was sloshing<l/>
            it at the place <del><gap reason="deleted" quantity="3" unit="character"></gap></del> where my mouth was when I last knew about it.<l/></p>
     
         <lb></lb>
         
         <p>We shouted as if in a high wind, about the review, and he saying<l/>
            <persName ref="#DanielWeissbort">Dan</persName> knew I was beautiful, he wouldn't have written it about a<l/>
            cripple, and my yelling drotest in which the words "sleep with<l/>
            the editor" occurred with startling frequency. And then it<l/>
            came to the fact that I was all there, wasn't I, and I stamped<l/>
            and screamed yes, and he had obligations in the next room, and<l/>
            he was working in <placeName ref="#London">London</placeName>, earning ten pounds a week so he could<l/>
            later earn twelve pounds a week, and I was stamping and he was<l/>
            stampig on the floor, and then hekissed me bang smash on the<l/>
            mouth and ripped my hairband off, my lovely red hairband scarf<l/>
            which has weathered the sun and much love, and whose like I<l/>
            shall never again find, and my favorite silver earrings: hah, I<l/>
            shall keep, he barked. And when he kissed my neck I bit him<l/>
            long and hard on the cheek, and when we came out of the room,<l/>
            blood was running down his face. His poem <quote>"I did it, I."</quote>Such<l/>
            violence, and I can see how women lie down for artists. The one<l/>
            man in the room who was as big as his poems, huge, with hulk<l/>
            and dynamic chunks of words; his poems are strong and blasting<l/>
            like a high wind in steel girders. And I screamed in myself,<l/>
            thinking: oh, to give myself crashing, fighting, to you. The<l/>
            one man since I've lived who could blast <persName ref="#Richard">Richard</persName>.<l/></p>
             
         <lb></lb>
            
         <p>And now I sit here, demure and tired in brown, slightly sick<l/>
            at heart. I shall zo on. I shall write a detalled description <del><gap reason="deleted" quantity="1" unit="character"></gap></del><l/>
            of shock treatment, tight, blasting short descriptions with<l/>
            not one smudge of coy sentimentality, and when I get enough<l/>
            I shall send them to <persName ref="#DavidRoss">David Ross</persName>. There will be no hurry,<l/>
            because I am too desperately vengeful now. But I will pile them<l/>
            up. I thought about the shock treatment description last night:<l/>
            the deadly sleep of her madness, and the breakfast not coming,<l/>
            the little details, the flashback to the shock treatment that<l/>
            went wrong: electrocution brought in, and the inevitable<l/>
            going down the subterranean hall, waking to a new world, with<l/>
            no name, being born again, and not of woman.<l/></p>
              
         <lb></lb>
            
         <p>I shall never see him again, and the thorny limitations of the<l/>
            day crowd in like the spikes on the gates at Queens last night<l/>
            I could never sleep with him anyway, with all his friends here<l/>
            and his close relation to them, laughing, talking, I should<l/>
            be the world's whore, as well as <persName ref="#Roget">Roget</persName>'s strumpet. I shall never<l/>
            see him, he will never look for me. He said my name, <persName ref="#SylviaPlath">Sylvia</persName>,<l/>
            and banged a black grinning look into my eyes, and I would like<l/>
            to try just this once, my force against his. But he will never<l/>
            come, and the blonde one, pure and snug and favored, looks, is<l/>
            it with projected nity and disguat<gap reason="illegible" quantity="1" unit="character"></gap>at this drunken amo<gap reason="illegible" quantity="2" unit="character"></gap>hic slut.<l/></p>
        
         <lb></lb>
             
         <p>But <persName ref="#HamishStewart">Hamish</persName> was very kind and would have fought for me. It gave<l/>
            him a kind of glory to take me away from them, those fiends and I am worth fighting for, I had been nice, to him, he said.<l/></p>

         <p>We walked out as the blonde one was coming in, and <persName ref="#Oswald">Oswald</persName> said<l/>
            in his dry sarcasm something about "Tell us about bone structures<l/>
            and that was the last party at Saint John's where I lost the<l/>
            red glove, as tonight I last the red bandeau which I loved with<l/>
            all the redness in my heart. Somehow these sluttish nights make<l/>
            me have a violent nunlike passion to write and sequester myself.<l/>
            I shall sequester. I don't want fo see anybody because they are<l/>
            not <persName ref="#TedHughes">Ted Hughes</persName>and I never have been made a fool of by a man.<l/>
            They are phonies, <persName ref="#HamishStewart">Hamish</persName> said: He is the biggest seducer in<l/>
            <placeName ref="#Cambridge">Cambridge</placeName>. Shall I write, and be different? Always, I grab it,<l/>
            the writing, hold it to me, defend, defend, against the flux,<l/>
            the sameness of faces. He said my name, <persName ref="#SylviaPlath">Sylvia</persName>, in a blasting<l/>
            wind which shot off in the desert behind my eyes, behind his<l/>
            eyes, and his poems are clever and terrible and lovely.<l/></p>
          
         <lb></lb>
            
         <p>Well, <persName ref="#HamishStewart">Hamish</persName>: and I took an incredibly long time walking about<l/>
            he misty streets in the moonlight and all was blurred behind<l/>
            a theatrical scrim of fog, and vague boys in black gowns staggered<l/>
            and sang. We hid behind a car, and he sild, the oroctors are<l/>
            out after me,and I kept blithering on about having faith and<l/>
            being lucky, always, if you believe in something, because you<l/>
            can walk on water. Finally, after many strange streets which<l/>
            I did not know, being far far away in a land of whisky and<l/>
            merrydown, saying <persName ref="#TedHughes">Ted</persName> to the lam<unclear rend="faded">po</unclear>osts and calding myself with<l/>
            <persName ref="#HamishStewart">Hamish</persName>, keeping saying it aloud to him, because he took<l/>
            me away safely. We came to the gates of Queens, and I wanted<l/>
            like a baby to lie down and rest, Just peace, peace, I kept<l/>
            whispering. Five boys, five late babies came up, and surrounded<l/>
            me, gently saying, what are you doing here, are you all right,<l/>
            my you smell nice, that perfume, and may we kiss you, and I<l/>
            just stood there huddled to the iron fence, smiling like a lost<l/>
            lamb and saying dear, dear, babies, and then <persName ref="#HamishStewart">Hamish</persName> was among<l/>
            them, and they climbed over and crossed the wooden bridge<l/>
            that <persName ref="#IsaacNewton">Newton</persName> once put together without bolts.<l/></p>
         
         <lb></lb>
         <lb></lb>
            
         <p><persName ref="HamishStewart">Hamish</persName> helped me up on the wall, and in my tight skirt, I<l/>
            tried to step over the spikes; they pierced my skirt, my hands<l/>
            and I felt nothing, thinking from the great distance that I<l/>
            might at last lie on a bed of solkes and not feel 1t, like<l/>
            the yoga, like celia copplestone, crucified, near an anthill,<l/>
            at last, peace, and the nails went through my hands, and my<l/>
            egs were bare to the thigh, and I was over. The stigmata, I<l/>
            sald, frozen, looking at those raw frigid hands that should<l/>
            have been bleeding. But they were not bleeding. I had gotten<l/>
            over in an act of sublime drunkenness and falth. And then we<l/>
            we<add place="above" rend="overwrite">nt</add> to <persName ref="#HamishStewart">Hamish</persName>'s room and lay on the floor by the fire and<l/>
            I was just so damn grateful for his weight on me and his mouth<l/>
            which was nice, and begged that he scold me, and he Just sald<l/>
            I wasn't a whore or a slut like I said but only a very silly<l/>
            girl and he kind of liked me and when would I learn-my lesson.<l/>
            When? When? So 1t was suddenly two—thirty, and I couldn't<l/>
            imagine being illegal, but I was, and we managed by the light<l/>
            of two matches to get downstairs, and he walked out, a dark<l/>
            lone figure against the pale white blur of snow in the dead<l/>
            quiet crescent court.<l/>

         <p>He beckoned, I came walking along the outer path, through the<l/>
            crust of snow, breaking, hearing the dry cru<del><gap reason="deleted" quantity="1" unit="character"></gap></del>nch and then<l/>
            crossing the snow fleld to him, walting for the sudden flash of<l/>
            light, the: hey, there, you stop<add place="inline">!</add> and the crack of pistols. It<l/>
            was dead quiet, and the cold snow was in my shoes and I felt<l/>
            nothing. We went through the gap in the box hedge, and <persName ref="#HamishStewart">Hamish</persName><l/>
            tested the ice on the river; he sald the porter chopped it,<l/>
            but it was whole, and bore us, and we crossed, free, walking<l/>
            home. And I heard the clocks striking three in the deathly<l/>
            quiet of dreaming people, and climbed the stairs somehow<l/>
            and went somehow after hot milk to bed.<l/>
         </p>
         
         <lb></lb>
         
         <p>And now it is today, and I slept only six hours and am weary<l/>
            and walting till next day and next to recover. I must write<l/>
            <persName ref="#JeanRacine">Racine</persName> paper, today, dinner with <persName ref="#Mallory">Mallory</persName> (can I live) and then<l/>
            <persName ref="#Ronsard">Ronsard</persName> desperately tomorrow.<l/>
         </p>
      
         <lb></lb> 
         
         <p>
            Perhaps at dinner they will be laughing at me. Well, they are<l/>
            hardly white, even though they are men. But I shall be sober,<l/>
            oh for so long. Why won't I see him agaln? But I won't. I dream<l/>
            of banging and crashing in a high wind in <placeName ref="#London">London</placeName>. But I want<l/>    
            to know him sober; I want to write to him, with that kind of<l/>
            discipline and blaze. So I shall shut up and get some sleep<l/>
            tonight and tomorrow, and do so.<l/>
