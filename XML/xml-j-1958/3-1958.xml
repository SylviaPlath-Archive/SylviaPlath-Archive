            love affair' with' a queer Finnish girl, death-oriented, who<l/>
            commits suicide (was he to blame, partly? did it really<l/>
            happen?) and a rather illuminating statement that<l/>
            he ("like most men") believes that loving a woman<l/>
            eternally isn't incompatible with leaving her: loving, leaving-<l/>
