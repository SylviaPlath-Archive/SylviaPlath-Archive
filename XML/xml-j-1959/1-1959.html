         <p>Thursday</p>
         <div class="l"></div>
         <p> <span class="date">April 23</span></p>
         <p>As with April, spring manifests itself in joyous news.</p>
         <div class="l"></div>
         <p> I am tired, having got up and out of <span class="persName">Ted</span>'s work-room by 7, after</p>
         <div class="l"></div>
         <p> two weeks of pre- and post-Guggenheim lethargy. We are transfigured,</p>
         <div class="l"></div>
         <p> After a near-miss, a query and palterling over the budget and the</p>
         <div class="l"></div>
         <p> lace of travel, we got it, and rounded off to the farthest thousand,</p>
         <div class="l"></div>
         <p> $5,000, which seems incredibly princely to us, After an imvitation</p>
         <div class="l"></div>
         <p> to <span class="orgName">Yaddo</span> for two months in September and October, which we at first</p>
         <div class="l"></div>
         <p> interpreted as a consolation prize, Guggenheim day: <span class="date">Friday April 10</span>,</p>
         <div class="l"></div><br/><p>Also, yesterday, my second acceptance from the <span style="text-decoration:underline">New Yorker </span>: a pleasant</p>
         <div class="l"></div>
         <p> two: the Watercolor of Granchester Meadows which I wrote bucolically</p>
         <div class="l"></div>
         <p> "for" them, and Man in Black, the only "love" poem in my book, and</p>
         <div class="l"></div>
         <p> the book-poém which I wrote only a little over a month ago at one</p>
         <div class="l"></div>
         <p> of my fruitful visits to <span class="placeName">Winthrop</span>, Must do justice to my father's</p>
         <div class="l"></div>
         <p> grave, Have rejected the Electra poem from my book, Too forced</p>
         <div class="l"></div>
         <p> end rhetorical, , A leaf from <span class="persName">Ann Sexton</span>s book would do here, She</p>
         <div class="l"></div>
         <p> has none of my elenches and an ease of phrase, and an honest<span class="deleted"> [...]</span>y.</p>
         <div class="l"></div>
         <p> I have my <span class="add">⟨4⟩</span>O unattackable poems. I think, And a joy about them</p>
         <div class="l"></div>
         <p> of sorts, Although I would love more potent ones, All the <span class="placeName">Smith</span></p>
         <div class="l"></div>
         <p> ones are miserable death-wishes, The ones here, however grey</p>
         <div class="l"></div>
         <p> (Companionalle Ills, Owl) have a verve and life=-joy.</p>
         <div class="l"></div><br/><p>I am still blocked sbout prose, A novel still scares me, Have</p>
         <div class="l"></div>
         <p> been reading "Passage to India" for the first time and admiring</p>
         <div class="l"></div>
         <p> the miraculous flow and eése of it, To have the time to show</p>
         <div class="l"></div>
         <p> the placing of a red card on a black, the change of daylight</p>
         <div class="l"></div>
         <p> and the geography of certain hills: the blessings of the novelists</p>
         <div class="l"></div>
         <p> wide untidy landscape art, It would be a certain therapy. But</p>
         <div class="l"></div>
         <p> if I do some good stories, that is the way toward the mountain,</p>
         <div class="l"></div>
         <p> I do not yet do them.</p><br/><p>I think too much yet about What Kind they should be and Where I</p>
         <div class="l"></div>
         <p> should publish them, Poems now are an evasion too, I have my</p>
         <div class="l"></div>
         <p> book as such and must not take the easy way of sitting a morning</p>
         <div class="l"></div>
         <p> before a poem in evasion from my children's Bed Book which I</p>
         <div class="l"></div>
         <p> long and yet fear to begin, Part of my passiveness., If you are</p>
         <div class="l"></div>
         <p> dead, noone can criticize you, or, if they do, it doesn't hurt.</p>
         <div class="l"></div><br/><p>The "dead black" in my poem may be a transference from the visit</p>
         <div class="l"></div>
         <p> = my father's grave.</p>
         <div class="l"></div><br/><p>Worked and worked with Beuscher: the skip of a week gave me courage</p>
         <div class="l"></div>
         <p> and momentum: stayed awake the whole night before thinking over what</p>
         <div class="l"></div>
         <p> I have come through and to, Concentrated on my suicide: a knot in</p>
         <div class="l"></div>
         <p> which much is caught, Weary still from the absolutely deadening</p>
         <div class="l"></div>
         <p> weekend in <span class="placeName">Northampton</span> and <span class="placeName">Holyoke</span>, The strain of <span class="placeName">Stanley</span>'s</p>
         <div class="l"></div>
         <p> intolerable position, How to overcome my naivete in writing?</p>
         <div class="l"></div>
         <p> Read others and think hard, Never step outside my own voice,</p>
         <div class="l"></div>
         <p> such as I know it,</p><br/><p>I think: a Wuthering Heights article for red-shoe money, Correct</p>
         <div class="l"></div>
         <p> the word in my Monitor poem, Start a poem for the bed book,</p>
         <div class="l"></div>
         <p> A story on the hospital, About the affair of Starbuck and Sexton.</p>
         <div class="l"></div>
         <p> A double story, <span class="persName">August Lighthill</span>and the Other Women.</p>
         <div class="l"></div>
         <p> Also about the children, seen through <span class="persName">Jan</span>'s eyes, Here is horror,</p>
         <div class="l"></div>
         <p> And_all the details, Get life in spurts in stories, then the novel</p>
         <div class="l"></div>
         <p> will come. A way, By the time I get to <span class="placeName">Yaddo</span>, three good publishable</p>
