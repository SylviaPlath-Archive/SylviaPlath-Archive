         <date>April 23</date></p>
            <p>As with April, spring manifests itself in joyous news.<l/>
               I am tired, having got up and out of <persName ref="#TedHughes">Ted</persName>'s work-room by 7, after<l/>
               two weeks of pre- and post-Guggenheim lethargy. We are transfigured,<l/>
               After a near-miss, a query and palterling over the budget and the<l/>
               lace of travel, we got it, and rounded off to the farthest thousand,<l/>
               $5,000, which seems incredibly princely to us, After an imvitation<l/>
               to <orgName ref="#Yaddo">Yaddo</orgName> for two months in September and October, which we at first<l/>
               interpreted as a consolation prize, Guggenheim day: <date>Friday April 10</date>,<l/>
            </p>
         
            <lb></lb>
         
            <p> Also, yesterday, my second acceptance from the <hi rend="underline"> New Yorker </hi>: a pleasant<l/>
               two: the Watercolor of Granchester Meadows which I wrote bucolically<l/>
               "for" them, and Man in Black, the only "love" poem in my book, and<l/>
               the book-poém which I wrote only a little over a month ago at one<l/>
               of my fruitful visits to <placeName ref="#Winthrop">Winthrop</placeName>, Must do justice to my father's<l/>
               grave, Have rejected the Electra poem from my book, Too forced<l/>
               end rhetorical, , A leaf from <persName ref="#AnnSexton">Ann Sexton</persName>s book would do here, She<l/>
               has none of my elenches and an ease of phrase, and an honest<gap rend="deleted"></gap>y.<l/>
               I have my <add>4</add>O unattackable poems. I think, And a joy about them<l/>
               of sorts, Although I would love more potent ones, All the <placeName ref="#Smith">Smith</placeName><l/>
               ones are miserable death-wishes, The ones here, however grey<l/>
               (Companionalle Ills, Owl) have a verve and life=-joy.<l/></p>
            
            <lb></lb>

            <p>I am still blocked sbout prose, A novel still scares me, Have<l/>
               been reading <objectName ref="PassageToIndia">"Passage to India"</objectName> for the first time and admiring<l/>
               the miraculous flow and eése of it, To have the time to show<l/>
               the placing of a red card on a black, the change of daylight<l/>
               and the geography of certain hills: the blessings of the novelists<l/>
               wide untidy landscape art, It would be a certain therapy. But<l/>
               if I do some good stories, that is the way toward the mountain,<l/>
               I do not yet do them.
            </p>
         
             <lb></lb>
      
            <p>I think too much yet about What Kind they should be and Where I<l/>
               should publish them, Poems now are an evasion too, I have my<l/>
               book as such and must not take the easy way of sitting a morning<l/>
               before a poem in evasion from my children's Bed Book which I<l/>
               long and yet fear to begin, Part of my passiveness., If you are<l/>
               dead, noone can criticize you, or, if they do, it doesn't hurt.<l/>
            </p>
         
            <lb></lb>
         
            <p>The "dead black" in my poem may be a transference from the visit<l/>
               = my father's grave.<l/>
            </p>
         
            <lb></lb>
            
            <p>Worked and worked with Beuscher: the skip of a week gave me courage<l/>
               and momentum: stayed awake the whole night before thinking over what<l/>
               I have come through and to, Concentrated on my suicide: a knot in<l/>
               which much is caught, Weary still from the absolutely deadening<l/>
               weekend in <placeName ref="#Northampton">Northampton</placeName> and <placeName ref="#Holyoke">Holyoke</placeName>, The strain of <placeName ref="Stanley">Stanley</placeName>'s<l/>
               intolerable position, How to overcome my naivete in writing?<l/>
               Read others and think hard, Never step outside my own voice,<l/>
               such as I know it,
             </p>
         
            <lb></lb>
   
            <p>I think: a Wuthering Heights article for red-shoe money, Correct<l/>
               the word in my Monitor poem, Start a poem for the bed book,<l/>
               A story on the hospital, About the affair of Starbuck and Sexton.<l/>
               A double story, <persName ref="#AugutstLighthill">August Lighthill</persName>and the Other Women.<l/>
               Also about the children, seen through <persName ref="#Jan">Jan</persName>'s eyes, Here is horror,<l/>
               And_all the details, Get life in spurts in stories, then the novel<l/>
               will come. A way, By the time I get to Yaddo, three good publishable<l/>
               stories and the Bed Book done<gap reason="deleted"></gap><l/>
