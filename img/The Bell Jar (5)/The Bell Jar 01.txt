CHAPTER I

It was a queer, sultry summer, the summer they electrocuted
the Rosenbergs, and I didn't know what I was doing in New York.

I'm stupide about executions. The idea of being electrocuted
makes me sick, that's all there was to read
about in the papers---goggle-eyed headlines staring up at me on 
every street corner and at the fusty, peanut-smelling mouth of 
every subway. It had nothing to do with me, but I couldn'thelp wondering what it would be like, being burned
alive all along your nerves. I thought Â© must be the worst thing in the world.

New York , was bad enough. By nine in the morning
the fake, country-wet freshness that somehow seeped in overnight
evaporated like the tail end of-a sweet dream. At the bottom of their 
granite canyons, the streets wavered in the sun, the car tops sizzled
and glittered, and the dry, cindery dust blew into my eyes and down my throat.

I kept hearing about he Rosenbergs over the radio and at 
the office till I couldn't get them out of my ymind. It was like
the first time I saw a cadaver. For weeks afterward, the cadaver's
head---or what there was left of it---floated up behind my eggs
and bacon at breakfast and behind the face of Buddy Willard, who
was responsible for my seeing it in the first place, and pretty
soon I felt to be carrying that cadaver's head around with me on
a string like some black, noseless balloon of vinegar.
