CHAPTER I

away, but later, when I was all right again, I brought them out,
and I still have them around the house. I use the lipsticks now
and then, and last week I cut the plastic starfish off the sun-
glasses case for the baby to play with.

There were twelve of us at the hotel, in the same wing
on the same floor in single rooms, one after the other, so it
reminded me of my dormitory at college. It wasn't a proper hotel--â€”-
I mean a hotel where there are both men and women mixed about here
and there on the same floor. This hotel was for women only, and
they were mostly girls my age with wealthy parents who wanted to
be sure their daughters would be living where men couldn(t get
at them and deceive them, and they were all going to posh secretarial
schools like Katy Gibbs, where they had to wear hats and stockings
and gloves to class, or they had just graduated from places like
Katy Gibbs and were secretaries to executives and junior executives
and simply hanging around in New York waiting to get married to
some career man or other.

These girls looked awfully bored to me. I saw them on
the sunroof, yawning and painting their nails and trying to keep
up their Bermuda tans, and they seemed bored as hell. I talked
with one of them, and she was bored with yachts and bored with
flying around in airplanes and bored with skiing in Switzerland
at Christmas and bored with the men in Brazil. Girls like that
make me sick. I'm so jealous of them I can't speak. Nineteen
years, and I hadn't been out of New England except
for this trip to New York. It was my first big chance,
but for some I was, just a back aad letting it MOVE my fingers.
