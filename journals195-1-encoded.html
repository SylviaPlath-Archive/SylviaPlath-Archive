         <p>A small note after a large orgy. It is morning, gray, most<br/> sober, with cold white purltanmical eyes; looking at me. Last<br/> night I got drunk, very very besutifully drunk, and now I am<br/> shot, after six holirs of warm sleep like a baby, with <span class="persName">Racine</span><br/> to read, and not even the energy to type; I am getting the dts.<br/> Or something.</p>
         <p><span class="persName">Hamish</span> came in cab, and there was a tedious time standing slanted<br/>against, the bar in Miller's with some ugly gat-toothed squat<br/>grinning guy named Meeson trying to be devastatingly clever and<br/>making intense devastating remarks about nothing. Hamish<br/>pale, pink and light blue eyes. I drank steadily the goblets<br/>with the redsgold Whiskey Macs, one-after the other, and by<br/>the time we left an hour later, I felt that strong, silted-up<br/>force that makes one move through alr like swimming, with<br/>brave ease.</p>
         <p>Falcon's Yard, and the syncopated strut of a piano upstairs,<br/>and oh it was very Bohemian, with boys in turtle-neck sweaters<br/>and girls being blue-eye-lidded or elegant in black. Derrek<br/>was there, with guitar, and Bert was looking shining and proud<br/>as 1f he had Just delivered five babies, sald something obvious<br/>about having drunk alot, and began talking about how Luke was<br/>satanic after we had run through the poetry in St. Botolph's<br/>and yelled about it: satanic Luke, very very drunk, with a<br/>stupid satanic smile on his pale face, dark sideburns and<br/>rumpled halr, black-and-white checked baggy pants and a loose<br/>swinging jacket, was doling that slow crazy english jive with<br/>a green-clad girl, quite black-halred and eyed and a good<br/>part pixie, and when they stopped dancing, Luke was chasing<br/>her around. Dan Huys being very pale, frightfully pale and<br/>freckled, and me at last saying my immortal line of introduction<br/>which has been with me ever since his clever precocious<br/>slanted review: "Is this the bedter or worse half?" and he<br/>looking incredibly young to even think hard yet. Than Minton,<br/>so small and dark one whuld have fo slit down to talk to him,<br/>and Welssbort, small agaln and very cur}y. Ross, immaculates<br/>“and dark. They were all dark.</p>
         <p>By this time I had spilled one drink, partly into my mouth,<br/>partly over my hands and the floor, and the Jazz was beginning<br/>to get under my skin, and I started dancing with Luke and<br/>knew I was very bad, having crossed the river and banged<br/>into the trees, yelling about the poems, and he only smiling<br/>with that far-off look of a ceetin satan. He wrote those<br/>things, and he was slobbing around. Well, I was slobbing<br/>around, ‘blub, maundering" and I didn't even have the excuse<br/>of having written those thinzs; I suwmpose if you can write<br/>sestinas waich wmbam crash through lines and rules after<br/>having raped them to the purpose, then you can be satanic and<br/>smile like a cretin beelzebub.</p>
         <p>Then the worst happened, that big, dark, hunky boy, the only<br/>one there huge enough for me, who hadwe been hunching around<br/>over women, and whose name I had asked the minute I had come<br/>into the room, but no one told me, came over and was looking<br/>hard in my eyes and it was Ted Hughes. I started yelling<br/>again about his poems and quoting: "dost dear unscratchable</p>
