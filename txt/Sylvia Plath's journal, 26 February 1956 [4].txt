February 26:

He beckoned, I came walking along the outer path, throuzh the
crust of snow, breaking, hearing the dry crummnch and then
crossing the snow fleld to him, walting for the sudden flash of
light, the: hey, there,you stop: and the crack of pistols. It
was dead quiet, and the cold snow was in my shoes and I felt
nothing. We wenZt through the gap in the box hedge, and Hamish
tested the ice on the river; he sald the porter chopped it,
but it was whole, and bore us, and we crossed, free, walking
home. And I heard the clocks striking three in the deathly
quiet of dreaming people, and climbed the stairs somehow

and went somehow after hot milk to bed.

And now it 1s today, and I slept only six hours and am weary
and walting till next day and nest to recover. I must write
Racine paper, today, dinner with Mallory (can I live) and then
Ronsard desperately tomorrow.

Perhaps at dinner they will be laughing at me. Well, they are
hardly white, even though they are men. But I shall be sober,
oh for so lonz. Why won Tt I see him agaln? But I won't. I dream
of banging and crashing in a hizh wind in London. But I want

to know him sober; I want to write to him, with that kind of
discipline and blaze. So I shall shut up and get some sleep
tonight and tomorrow, and do so.
